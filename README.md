# core-ui

Comindware Core UI is a set of components based on Marionette framework and some other third-party libraries. It's built in the best tradition of Marionette and enables you to create complex modular UI by nesting powerful ready-to-use components.

The package includes a variety of components such as editors, layouts, lists, dropdowns, as well as several high-level services to build pop-ups, show messages, arrange RPC-ajax communication and localize the application.

For more details have a look at the [demo](https://comindware.github.io/core-ui/) and JSDoc-based [documentation](https://comindware.github.io/core-ui/doc/).
